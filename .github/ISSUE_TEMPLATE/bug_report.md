<!-- Thank you for creating this bug report. -->
<!-- Texts like these are comments to help you create the bug report and will not be visible in the final bugreport. -->

**OS**: <!-- Your operating system and it's version. For Windows, please specify if it is 64 or 32 bit. 
 For Linux, please also include your distribution name and version. -->
**Linux Desktop Manager**: <!-- For Linux, please include your desktop manager (KDE, Gnome, etc). Please keep in mind that Qt system tray implementation is not compatible with many "smaller" desktop managers which take shortcuts in implementing the full specs. Cinnamon and MATE have known issues. Please do not submit system tray-related bugs for those desktop managers as they cannot be fixed in Birdtray. The examples of such bugs include starting Birdtray with WM, and accessing Birdtray menu using left-click or right-click. -->
**Birdtray version**: <!-- The version of Birdtray, can be found in the "About" tab of the preferences. -->
**Thunderbird version**: <!-- The Thunderbird version. -->
**Birdtray origin**: <!-- How did you install Birdtray? Possible options could be: "From source", "From installer" or "From package manager". Please note that if the issue happens in a packaged version, you should submit a bug report to the package maintainer. We do not build deb/rpm/flatpac packages and we do not know what version it was based on, and what has been included. Such bug reports will not be accepted. -->
**Qt version**: _NA_ <!-- Only fill this, if you compiled Birdtray yourself. -->
